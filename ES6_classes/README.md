## Introduction

ES6 classes provide a cleaner and more intuitive syntax for creating objects and working with inheritance in JavaScript. They are syntactic sugar over JavaScript's existing prototype-based inheritance.

## Features of ES6 Classes

- Simplified syntax for defining classes.
- Support for constructors.
- Inheritance using the `extends` keyword.
- Static methods and properties.
- Encapsulation with private fields (introduced in later versions).

## Getting Started

To follow along with the examples in this repository, ensure you have:

- A modern web browser or Node.js installed.
- Basic knowledge of JavaScript.

Clone this repository and explore the examples provided.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/ES6_classes.git
cd ES6_classes
```

## Examples

- Defining a class
