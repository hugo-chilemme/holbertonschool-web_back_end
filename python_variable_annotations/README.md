# Python - Variable Annotations

This project focuses on learning and implementing variable annotations in Python. Variable annotations are a way to add type hints to your Python code, making it easier to understand and maintain.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the purpose of type annotations.
- Learn how to use type hints in Python functions and variables.
- Explore the `typing` module for advanced type annotations.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Knowledge of basic Python programming.

## Project Structure

- **Tasks**: Exercises to practice variable annotations.
- **Examples**: Code snippets demonstrating the use of type hints.

## Resources

- [Python Documentation on Type Hints](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html)
- [PEP 484 â€“ Type Hints](https://peps.python.org/pep-0484/)
