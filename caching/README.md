## üìÑ Description

This project explores various caching algorithms and their Python implementations. Caching systems store and retrieve data efficiently, reducing the need for recalculations or slower data-fetching processes. Implementations include algorithms such as `FIFO`, `LIFO`, `LRU`, `MRU`, and `LFU`.

## üéì Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Explain what a caching system is and its purpose.
- Define and implement the following caching algorithms:
    - `FIFO` (First In, First Out)
    - `LIFO` (Last In, First Out)
    - `LRU` (Least Recently Used)
    - `MRU` (Most Recently Used)
    - `LFU` (Least Frequently Used)
- Understand the limitations of caching systems.

## üìã Requirements

- All files must end with a new line.
- The first line of all files should be `#!/usr/bin/env python3`.
- A `README.md` file at the root of the project is mandatory.
- Code must follow `pycodestyle` (version 2.5).
- All files must be executable.
- File lengths will be tested using `wc`.
- Modules, classes, and functions must include proper documentation.

## üìù Instructions

### Tasks Overview

1. **Basic Dictionary**: Implement a caching system with no size limit.
2. **FIFO Caching**: Implement a caching system using the FIFO algorithm.
3. **LIFO Caching**: Implement a caching system using the LIFO algorithm.
4. **LRU Caching**: Implement a caching system using the LRU algorithm.
5. **MRU Caching**: Implement a caching system using the MRU algorithm.
6. **LFU Caching**: Implement a caching system using the LFU algorithm.

Each task includes specific requirements and test cases to validate your implementation.

## üíª Installation and Usage

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/fchavonet/holbertonschool-web_back_end.git
     ```
2. Navigate to the `caching` directory:
     ```bash
     cd holbertonschool-web_back_end/caching
     ```
3. Ensure all files are executable:
     ```bash
     chmod +x *.py
     ```

### Usage

Run the test files for each task:
```bash
python3 0-main.py
python3 1-main.py
python3 2-main.py
python3 3-main.py
python3 4-main.py
python3 100-main.py
```

Modify the test files as needed to test other caching systems.
