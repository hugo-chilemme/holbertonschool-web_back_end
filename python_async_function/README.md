# Python - Async

This project explores asynchronous programming in Python. It covers the use of `asyncio`, `async` and `await` keywords, and demonstrates how to write efficient, non-blocking code.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the basics of asynchronous programming.
- Learn how to use `asyncio` for managing asynchronous tasks.
- Explore the `async` and `await` syntax in Python.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or later.
- Familiarity with Python programming.

## Project Structure

- **Tasks**: Examples and exercises to practice asynchronous programming.
- **Documentation**: Detailed explanations of concepts and code samples.

## Resources

- [Python asyncio Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html)
- [PEP 492 â€“ Coroutines with async and await syntax](https://peps.python.org/pep-0492/)
